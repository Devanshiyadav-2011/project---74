        <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, we were completely
          shocked when we got to know that we’ve won the first prize in our Inter School debate on environmental
          pollution. It was the second time when we participated in debate competition. At the time when we participated
          for the very first time so we didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time we felt a little sad but we
          decided that we’d do more hard work and we will participate again and I guess that we took the right decision
          to participate again, Also we learnt that hard work always pays off because At our first participation, we were
          not concerned towards this competition but when we faced failure then It inspired us to do more hard work and
          because of that we have gotten this prize, Our parents were very proud of us. We have known that hard work is
          most important to achieve success.
